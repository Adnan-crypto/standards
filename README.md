# Standards - Psychedelic

Here's a record of all Internet Computer standards that came to be either through the Psychedelic DAO or the ecosystems' entrepeneur, developer, and community collective, as well as any approved proposals ðŸ”¥ All are aimed to provide consensualized standards for development on the Internet Computer, driving seamless and consistent experiences across the network.

## The First - Token Standard/Interface

The community's first standard is a universal Token standard/interface for the Internet Computer that uses Principal IDs as a user's unique identifier when associating them to their balance. This standard is a simple ERC20-like common interface which could be used for tokens on DFINITY's Internet Computer, aiming to provide the most composability across tokens, interfaces, applications, open internet services, and the Internet Computer itself.
