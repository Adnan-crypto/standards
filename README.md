# Standards - Psychedelic

Here's a record of all Internet Computer standards that came to be either through Psychedelic  or the ecosystems' entrepeneur, developer, and community collective, as well as any approved proposals ðŸ”¥ All are aimed to provide consensualized standards for development on the Internet Computer, driving seamless and consistent experiences across the network.

## Token Standard/Interface

The community's first standard is a [universal Token standard/interface](https://github.com/Psychedelic-DAO/standards/tree/main/standards/token-standard) for the Internet Computer that uses Principal IDs as a user's unique identifier when associating them to their balance. This standard is a simple ERC20-like common interface which could be used for tokens on DFINITY's Internet Computer, aiming to provide the most composability across tokens, interfaces, applications, open internet services, and the Internet Computer itself.

## Principal IDs as Unique Identifiers.

The community's first conjoint proposal is a standard for using Principal IDâ€™s as the universal unique identifier for the Internet Computer, instead of using Account IDâ€™s, Wallet IDâ€™s, User IDâ€™s, or any other additional unique identifier that is currently being used for ICP, tokens, apps, cycles, etc.. 

Furthermore this proposal aims to establish an alternative approach to user identity/authentication on the Internet Computer that moves away from the hostname specific Principal IDâ€™s currently being used by Internet Identity, and instead optimizes/caters more to the Web3/crypto/token/composability side of the Internet Computer ecosystem by following the Web3 identity/auth/UX patterns users are already familiar with.
